# Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree
Learning to design data models, build data warehouses and data lakes, automate data pipelines, and work with massive datasets.

# Projects
## 1. Data Modeling
- Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres
In this project, you’ll model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. You’ll create a relational database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. In PostgreSQL you will also define Fact and Dimension tables and insert data into your new tables.
- Project 2: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
In this project, you’ll model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. You’ll create a noSQL database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. You’ll model your data in Apache Cassandra to allow for specific queries provided by the analytics team at Sparkify.
